This is a simple program for a simple purpose.

Created by Chris Reister at a Ruby Users Group meeting in about 10 minutes because of our giveaways required adding a bunch of names to an array and picking a random winner at many meetings.  Now we have a tool we can use to help keep it really random.

I am not much of a test suite type of guy, but wrote my own simple test frame work for this, so this include SimpleTest, which I may release as a separate project soon.

This was designed as a command line tool.  I am sure it will morph if I have time, or others want to make edits.  My Ruby Users Group is planning on integrating it into our website to make giveaways and drawings quick simple and online, as a learning experience for the users.

Simple use via irb:
> irb

> require 'pickle_jar'
> PickleJar.add_names("Chris, Karmen, Aaron, Josh, Andrew")
> PickleJar.winner_is
>> "Karmen"

It includes functions:
PickleJar.add_name
PickleJar.add_names
PickleJar.remove_name
PickleJar.remove_names
PickleJar.winner_is
PickleJar.shake
PickleJar.peek_in_jar
PickleJar.empty

how to run the SimpleTest
> ruby pickle_jar_test.rb
